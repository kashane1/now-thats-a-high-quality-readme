This link is a  walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the application.

A sampleREADME.md file is included to show what this application can create.

## Requirements
1. The command-line application accepts user input and writes a detailed README.md file
2. The user is prompted for the title of their project, followed by a prompt for description, installation, usage, license, contributing, test, and questions.
3. The information the user inputs in then added to the corresponding sections on the README file and a table of contents is created as well.
4. The last prompts to the user as for GitHub username and email to build out a Questions section in the README file.

## Process
I was able to work through this assignment with ounly a few road blocks. I thought I was going to have to build my own license.js file and then export it. Afterwards I found the generateMarkdown.js and that made things a lot more straight forward. The starter code really helped me. It gives a great outline of what needs to get done so I don't get hung up on and pseudo code or outlining.
